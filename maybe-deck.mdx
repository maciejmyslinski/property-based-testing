# Generators

```notes
deliberate randomness â€“ not completly random
it generates both small and large values, making
it easier to dig into counterexamples without having to tweak a size parameter manually
```

---

[code example]

```notes
this code example uses fast-check arbitraries

here the audience see fast-check for the first time
tell them why you like it
```

---

# Runners

---

[code example]

```notes
this code example uses fast-check runners

ok, so you run those tests with randomly generated data
suddenly a test fails
and it says: well, I failed, here is 300 random strings I generated
```

[messy output from test runner without shrinking]

```notes
good luck debugging it!

noise is good for provoking failure but it's bad for debugging it
not all inputs contribute to failure
```

---

# Shrinkers

---

[shrinked counter example]

```notes
seems like negative numbers are causing a problem
you can take this counterexample, create an example-based test out of it
and this way protect against regressions. You can not be sure the generator will find this bug ever again.

another thing you can do is take the counter example and pass it as an example to the runner

or take the seed. A seed is a datetime that a generator was starting with; it allows you to generate the same data.

[emoji of something connected with 'the wild']

```notes
tell the audience about PBT in the wild - stories of real companies
that found and solved real bugs with it
```

[example code for model]

---

[example code for real system]

```notes
just a rendered component
```

---

[example code for a command]

```notes
class with methods: check, run (execution, postconditins), toString
```

---

we have to generate commands somehow

---

now glue all of this together

---

[raport of a failing test]

```notes
show raport and explain the raport of a failing test
on the next slide show how shrinking works (encountered failures in the raport)
```

---

demo of a failing test like in codesandbox but embedded into the slide
