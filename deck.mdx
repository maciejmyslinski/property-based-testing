# The Missing Piece of Testing

---

# ‚úàÔ∏è

```notes
I always wantend to be a pilot (freedom, expert, safe)
most of you came here by a plane
think about software that runs that plane
how well would you like that software to be tested?
we write software too, how do we test it?

TODO: find more how planes are tested, maybe something funny
about breaking wings.

```notes
once upon a time there was a sort function that took
1 and two as arguments and returned 3 as a result

highlights:
* sort
* arguments
* result
* all
* arguments
* test name

GOOD:

* easy to read/write
* default way of communicating
* regressions

BAD:
* it's not clear what's an accidential detail
  * is this important that we have 2 and 3?
  * can I put a string there?
  * what about negative numbers?
* how do you come up with this data anyway?
  * do you roll a dice
  * ask your mom
  * ask a friend to count in his mind until you say 'stop'
* Garbage In/Garbage Out ‚Äì Your Output is Only as Good as Your Inputs
  * what's the quality of your inputs? it's rubbish
  * oh, but I write more examples, you know
    * sure, but first that's boring
    * you're only covering edge cases you could come up with
    * how do you deal with edge cases you don't know?
* doesn't deliver on the generality it claims
* you didn't proof it works
  * the result of this test is telling you: I couldn't find a bug this time
  * the problem is the next time it's trying the same thing
  * how do you call a man who's trying the same thing over and over again and expects a different results?

> Testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs.

Edsger W. Dijkstra

```notes
early pioneer in computing science

it works for my examples so whatever, it probably works for other, let's ship it

‚úàÔ∏è would you like airplanes to work this way?

"oh, it worked during our flight, sorry"

shouldn't your tests help you find bugs instead of luring you there are none?

HOW? first of, data that comes in. computers are great with generating data. let the computer do it.

TODO: style it better

good and bad things highlighted with a surfer

# Good
- list
- of good things
- about example based testing

# Bad
- list
- of bad things
- about example based testing

I'll explain concepts on silly example
don't worry, I'll show you real-live example
for a frontend project once we grasp the basics

# Randomize input

```notes
tell what problems random input addresses
let a computer generate test cases so we don't have to

design the API so that it's similar to fast-check

```

---

[code example]

```notes
FUZZING or fuzz testing is an automated software testing technique
that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as
inputs to a computer program. The program is then monitored for
exceptions such as crashes, or failing built-in code assertions or
for finding potential memory leaks.

not super useful

that's all great, but how do we write assertions?
```

# Properties

```notes
explain what are properties

'if this sounds confusing for you, let me tell you a story'
```

---

```notes

```

---

[code example]

```notes
here you write assertions using properties

and when you write such a test, start in in watch mode
and develop in the meantime, you tested houndreads of
examples before you even push it

note that you YOU NEED NO FRAMEWORK to write property based tests
all you need is to create a generator that yields some random data
and define properties of the output. That's it.

However, frameworks give you some important things for free.
for a frontend project once we grasp the basics

```

---

# Generators

```notes
deliberate randomness ‚Äì not completly random
it generates both small and large values, making
it easier to dig into counterexamples without having to tweak a size parameter manually
```

---

[code example]

```notes
this code example uses fast-check arbitraries

here the audience see fast-check for the first time
tell them why you like it
```

---

# Runners

---

[code example]

```notes
this code example uses fast-check runners

ok, so you run those tests with randomly generated data
suddenly a test fails
and it says: well, I failed, here is 300 random strings I generated
```

---

[messy output from test runner without shrinking]

```notes
good luck debugging it!

noise is good for provoking failure but it's bad for debugging it
not all inputs contribute to failure
```

---

# Shrinkers

---

[shrinked counter example]

```notes
seems like negative numbers are causing a problem
you can take this counterexample, create an example-based test out of it
and this way protect against regressions. You can not be sure the generator will find this bug ever again.

another thing you can do is take the counter example and pass it as an example to the runner

or take the seed. A seed is a datetime that a generator was starting with; it allows you to generate the same data.

# Google

```notes
LevelDB is a fast key-value storage C++ library written at Google that
provides an ordered mapping from string keys to string values.
```

---

# Spotify

```notes
shared module  that handles the sequencing of tracks (not the actual
audio playback) including shuffling, repeating tracks,
repeating playlists and so for.

1. Turn on playlist repeat.
2. Prepare playback of a playlist with a single track, let‚Äôs call this track A.
3. Play the prepared playlist.
4. Add a single track to the start of the playlist.
5. Skip to the next track.

Since we have repeat enabled, we expect to wrap around to the newly added track
when we advance from the first track. However, instead we get the same track again.
This was even easily reproducible in both the iOS and Android clients!

# Enough it Enough

Enough is enough. We are frontend devs.
We don't implement sort functions, nor advanced backend logic
for music players, let alone databases.
And you promised us to show a real live frontend example.

# üèÅ

```notes
tell a short story of final-form
  - redux-form
  - a lot of experience
  - framework agnostic
  - smaller
  - 100% coverage with example based tests
  - 3249 github stars
  - 33402 weekly downloads on npm

you would expect that kind of library fairly bug-free, wouldn't you?
and yet, I decided to write a PBT for it.

and surprisingly I found some bugs

part of this final-form's ecosystem is a package for array-like structure in forms

[snapshot of react-arrays methods]

on this slide show that only 2 of those 9 methods would not cause bugs
strikethrough the buggy ones

# 4 already known

# 6 new

if we as a community would employ PBT earlier, those 4 bugs could never enter
our productions codebase.
