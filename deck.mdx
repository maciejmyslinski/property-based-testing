# The Missing Piece of Testing

```notes
I always wantend to be a pilot (freedom, know details about all those switches inside the cocpit, safe)
some of you came here by a plane
think about software that runs that plane
how well would you like that software to be tested?
we write software too, how do we test it?

TODO: find more how planes are tested, maybe something funny
about breaking wings.

<ExampleBasedTest />

```notes
once upon a time there was a sort function that took
1 and two as arguments and returned 3 as a result

highlights:
* sort
* arguments
* result
* all
* arguments
* test name

GOOD:

* easy to read/write
* default way of communicating
* regressions

BAD:
* it's not clear what's an accidential detail
  * is this important that we have 2 and 3?
  * can I put a string there?
  * what about negative numbers?
* how do you come up with this data anyway?
  * do you roll a dice
  * ask your mom
  * ask a friend to count in his mind until you say 'stop'
* Garbage In/Garbage Out ‚Äì Your Output is Only as Good as Your Inputs
  * what's the quality of your inputs? it's rubbish
  * oh, but I write more examples, you know
    * sure, but first that's boring
    * you're only covering edge cases you could come up with
    * how do you deal with edge cases you don't know?
* doesn't deliver on the generality it claims
* you didn't proof it works
  * the result of this test is telling you: I couldn't find a bug this time
  * the problem is the next time it's trying the same thing
  * how do you call a man who's trying the same thing over and over again and expects a different results?

> Testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs.

Edsger W. Dijkstra

```notes
early pioneer in computing science

it works for my examples so whatever, it probably works for other, let's ship it

‚úàÔ∏è would you like airplanes to work this way?

"oh, it worked during our flight, sorry"

shouldn't your tests help you find bugs instead of luring you there are none?

HOW? first of, data that comes in. computers are great with generating data. let the computer do it.

<SortRandomInputs />

```notes
let a computer generate test cases so we don't have to

FUZZING or fuzz testing is an automated software testing technique
that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as
inputs to a computer program. The program is then monitored for
exceptions such as crashes, or failing built-in code assertions or
for finding potential memory leaks.

not super useful

* the sliver of it (not complete) ‚Äì size problem
* empty plate ‚Äì presence / emptiness problem
* 2 of them ‚Äì an enumeration problem
* melted sandwitch ‚Äì range problem (the temperature has to be in a certain range)
* wrong shape (complete, but misplaced pieces) ‚Äì wrong relationship between the parts

```notes
here you write assertions using properties

we now can run this multiple times

run-multiple-times

```notes
and when you write such a test, start in in watch mode
and develop in the meantime, you tested houndreads of
examples before you even push it

note that you YOU NEED NO FRAMEWORK to write property based tests
all you need is to create a generator that yields some random data
and define properties of the output. That's it.

However, frameworks give you some important things for free.

both-example-and-property

```notes
you should have both

keep you examples! this is the complete test suite: we not only tell some
vague story, we also describe what it should do in general,
we specify requirements.

And that's exactly what tests should do, specify requirements, then give some examples.
you can notice property-based-tests are usually more complecated
which is a downside

so let's run it

it failed for [10, 0] example
we just discovered a bug we could've miss with example based testing

it's like an insurance.

now we are save against regressions
and employ computers to find more bugs for us

# Spotify

```notes
C++ shared module that handles the sequencing of tracks
including shuffling, repeating tracks,
repeating playlists and so for.

TODO: create a graph for these steps
1. Turn on playlist repeat.
2. Prepare playback of a playlist with a single track, let‚Äôs call this track A.
3. Play the prepared playlist.
4. Add a single track to the start of the playlist.
5. Skip to the next track.

TODO: create a slide with ios and adroid clients
Since we have repeat enabled, we expect to wrap around to the newly added track
when we advance from the first track. However, instead we get the same track again.
This was even easily reproducible in both the iOS and Android clients!

[snapshot of methods provided by final-form-arrays]

```notes
tell a short story of final-form
  - redux-form
  - a lot of experience
  - framework agnostic
  - smaller
  - 100% coverage with example based tests
  - 3249 github stars
  - 33402 weekly downloads on npm

part of this final-form's ecosystem is a package for array-like structure in forms
react-final-form-arrays
  - 11,272 weekly downloads

you would expect that kind of library fairly bug-free, wouldn't you?
I decided to write a PBT for it.

and surprisingly I found some bugs
